# My Tasks AWS

This project contains source code and supporting files for a To Do List serverless application that you can deploy with the AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) command line interface (CLI). The application runs on Node.js runtime environment and makes use of AWS services like AWS Lambda, Amazon DynamoDB and Amazon API Gateway. Source code is written in TypeScript and unit tests are implemented using the Jest library. A GitHub pipeline configuration is also in place.
